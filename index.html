  	<h1 class="skiername">1. Phil Casabon</h1>
    <hr class="underlineskier">
    </a>

    <p class="skiercontent">Originaly from Quebec, this skier embraces the baggy style with ease. What I enjoy about his skiing is how aggressive he is on rails. He produces his own ski movies with high quality production which makes it even a better skier as he takes as much time to ski and to produce his movies. It is good for the ski community in Quebec to have one of the best skier of this generation representing them. He is sponsored by multiple companies but most importantly one named Armada, a company that is known world wide to make incredebly good skis. Following Casabon this winter will give you the opportunity to watch, in my opinion, one of the best ski movies a skier has to offer. Plus, supporting a Quebec skier is good for our ski community.</p>

    </a>
    
    <p class="skiercontent">Voll brings to the mountain the best that skiing has to offer. His style mixes elements from aggressive to swervy with ease. I first heard about him through his superunknown videos, a ski contest for the best edits. When he got on the ON3P team I started following him with more intensity and he soon became one of my favorite skier. His appearances in the third ON3P movie blew my mind away and I still have the same reactions after replaying the video so many times. His 19-20 season recap was amazing too, which is why following him this season will ensure you don't miss his new tricks until he drops next season's recap. </p>

    </a>
    
    <p class="skiercontent">
      Magnus is the skier who got me interested in freeskiing. 3 years ago, I didn't know how big of an influence skiing would be on my life. All this is possible because of one video on instagram I saw. It was Magnus doing "wierd things (As I thought 3 years ago)" with his skis that made me buy new skis and decided to give all my will to try harder and harder things. Looking back at it, I would not be in love with skiing as much as I am today without Magnus. I recommend everyone to follow him to support him as I think I owe him that. His loose style makes me enjoy skiing doing things other people on the hill find funny. Overall, he is a really good skier that has a special place in my heart because his videos got me into skiing.

    <hr class="underlineskier">
    </a>
    
    <p class="skiercontent">
      SkrtSkrtSwerve is a skier that I look up a lot to. Mostly because his style is my unique by being loose and wearing really cool outfits. Unfortunately, Ian does not post as much as the other skier on the list on instagram. This is sad because I could watch his videos all day. We can see him in edits of other people and on the ON3P movies from time to time. If he had more content, he would be my favorite skier. I recommend following him because who knows, maybe he will post a lot of picture this season ?!

    <p class="skiercontent">
      Jake Mageau is a skier that rides for ON3P like some others on the list. He won the viewers vote in the last real ski contest. This video was so insane I watched it like 10 times. He never stops bringing new content that amazes me. I absolutly love his style because it is so unique. He is a big part of the new ON3P movie which dropped not so long ago. This movie proves that he isnt just good at rails. In fact, the movie was only powder shots and they were all amazing. I hope more is to come this season from Jake.

    <p class="skiercontent">
      Henrik as the og style of skiing. I love this skier mostly for the happiness he let go when he skis. He seems to have a really good sport attitude which I think is an important aspect to an athlete. His movies and edits are always so good because of the editing, the music but mostly the skiing. To my eyes, he is probably the best mainstream skier when it comes to park skiing. It is important to follow him this season because his next movie "Salute" is going to drop soon.

    <p class="skiercontent">I Started skiing when I was 3 years old. Unfortunately, I discovered the pleasure of park skiing only 2-3 years ago but I really started improving last year. I plan on skiing more than ever this year and land my goal tricks such as backslide backswap to switch or 2 in frontswitchup to pretz 2. Not long ago, ,my friends and I made a little spot in my backyard to pratice. The rail was not long enough to do the tricks I wanted to do but we had a lot of fun. Click on the video to see what I managed to get during this spot session : </p>

    <p class="skiercontent">I often go to my local mountain's park to enjoy the various modules there is. We don't film a lot during our session at the mountain but I have a little video of a trick I started doing not long ago and it looks pretty nice. I could not get it how I like it to look like but the video below is this trick, called a backswap to forward : </p>

    <div class="listiclebrand">
    <p style="font-size: 19px;">My listicle is done, but I want to add that in this video I am wearing my favorite ski outfit. It is mainly a combination of 2 brands that are yet to be known worldwide. If I would have to make a listicle about my favorite clothing brands these 2 would be at the top because the clothing they make is custom and hand made.</p>

    <p>Vishnu is a company that makes the most flexible skis I have ever skiied. I love these skis and still use them for street skiing. They sell clothes on theyre website along with the skis. I find the clothing they make to fit my style perfectly. In this video, I am wearing Vishnu custom pants.</p>

    <p>Sovyrn is a company ran by one guy from what I know. I love his skiing style which made me start looking at what he sells. He mostly makes custom mittens but he customs every kind of clothes. I bought mittens from him and they were perfect for my outfit. Unfortunately, they broke due to the cold but I still use them like in the video because they still keep me warm and still look good. I bought a ski mask from him too which is probably my favorite piece of my outift. I often wear it as a beanie because it is mostly always hot but the mask really looks good and will keep me really warm this winter</p>
